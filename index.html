                <p>Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward
                    Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries
                    like
                    the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Björn Borg–John McEnroe rivalry in tennis, and
                    the
                    Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[493][49</p>
